# A basic LLM Chatbot with LangChain

This repo contains the source code for an LLM Chatbot, built with LangChain. The goal of the project was to learn to build out a basic implementation of a chatbot.

If you'd like to download this repo use the following:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dsogden/GPT-clone
```

The chatbot uses OpenAI LLMs, specifically "gpt-4o-mini", and will require an OpenAI API Key. I have also set up tracing with LangSmith so you need an API key for that as well. All of this information needs to be dumped into a .env file in the root directory with the following format:
```
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<LangSmith API Key>
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=<LangSmith Project Name>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI API Key>
LLM_MODEL=<OPENAI Model>
```

## Example screenshot of the functionality.
The frontend for the implementation is Streamlit.
